## Open references quickly
Open a book, lecture notes or a paper using their biblatex alphabetic style citation. For example,
```
$ b har77
```
would open the book published by Hartshorne in 1977. If there are several options available, say
```
$ p ser55
```
for a paper published by Serre in 1955, then the output will say so and give the list of all available options.
